## Introduction
This repository documents my progress in mastering SQL. Each project builds upon the previous one, progressively increasing in complexity to challenge my understanding and improve my skills.

## Completed Challenges

### 1. Basic Queries
- Wrote basic `SELECT` statements.
- Used `WHERE` for filtering rows based on conditions.
- Practiced `ORDER BY` to sort query results.

### 2. Joins and Aggregations
- Performed `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `RIGHT JOIN` operations.
- Aggregated data using `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, and `MIN()`.
- Grouped data with `GROUP BY` and filtered groups with `HAVING`.

### 3. Window Functions
- Learned to use `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, and `ROW_NUMBER()` for advanced data analysis.
- Applied `PARTITION BY` to calculate aggregations within groups.

### 4. Subqueries and CTEs
- Used subqueries to calculate average salaries and filter employees.
- Applied `WITH` (Common Table Expressions) to organize and simplify queries.

### 5. Case Statements and Grouping
- Categorized data with `CASE` into custom groups.
- Grouped employees based on salary levels and years of work experience.
